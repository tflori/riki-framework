# ríki

This is a minimalistic framework. The only thing this framework defines (for now) is how to configure the project and
how to define special behaviour on an environment.

## Documentation

This framework is not the same as other frameworks. There is no fixed directory structure. No abstract controller or
something else where we could help you developing your application.

Instead of concentrating on the way to develop your application the focus is a lean, fast and understandable
application.

Because of this is not really a framework we built a community platform that helps you developing using no framework.

## Config

The example how to use this framework (or how to develop without a framework) is the [ríki community platform
](https://github.com/tflori/riki-community).

## Install

You should really use the [guide](https://riki.w00tserver.org) to learn more about this philosophiwc approach of php
development.

Anyway you can install this library as any other library as well: 

```console
$ composer require tflori/riki-framework
```
